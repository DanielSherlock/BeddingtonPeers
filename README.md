## Progress

Uh, so I can't seem to get the PeerJS connection to open - dunno where the problem is: my code, PeerJS, my home network... It's very irritating. Anyway, consider the P2P part of this project stale for the forseeable future.

The next steps are to start work on the game itself, with fairly hefty decoupling from the comms side of things. Hopefully this will be done in such a way that it's at least easy to play a local game, or switch to something better than PeerJS (i.e. anything that works). All the PeerJS stuff will be left as junk code for now.
